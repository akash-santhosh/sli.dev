# Skills
 - Perhaps one of the most beneficial aspects of getting involved on campus is that it offers you the chance to develop and build skills that you wouldn't get to otherwise. Participation and working with others helps you to round out your soft skills.

 - Partaking in college clubs and organizations alongside your academic responsibilities allows you to practice not only discipline, but also time management. This is a handy skill to have in your personal life, and it's one that future employers will be looking for after you graduate.

 - Collaborating to study new lessons, complete assignments and work on projects helps students approach their course content differently. They are better equipped to critically analyse what they are studying and use logic and reasoning to process any new information.

# What is **Networking** ??
 dont read btw, this is just for a rasam

Many people believe that networking during a job search means calling everyone and asking them for a job. People associate networking with being pushy and overbearing. Some people tend to hide away from networking because they don‚Äôt want to be labeled as this type of person. Networking is a two way street, it is a way of getting to know someone better and finding ways they might be able to help you and how you can help them in return.

A professional networking event is a great opportunity to present yourself, make new connections and even find yourself a new job. Current research shows that a large number of jobs are filled through networking. Successful networkers display a sincere interest in their networking contacts and work hard to develop a relationship, establish their credibility and share their information and knowledge. To become a successful networker, you should follow the belief that everyone has something to learn and gain. 

Networking is an ongoing process, it requires persistence, attention, organisation and good will. Incorporate the art of networking into your job search and you will gain opportunities and build relationships that will last a lifetime.
